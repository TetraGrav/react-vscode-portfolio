# üèÜ Accomplishments
**777X Program Excellence Award** @ [Boeing](https://boeing.com/) 
Performance award for the management of testing on the 777x fuselage.

**Boeing BASE** @ [Boeing](https://boeing.com/) 
Co-creator of Boeing Accelerated Simulation In Engineering (BASE), a program to quickly mentor & bring new hires up to speed on working in the aerospace industry through professional projects.

**President Formula SAE** @ [VCU](https://vcu.edu/) 
President of Formula SAE at my university. Tasked with managing, designing, building and fundraising for a miniature formula 1 race-car. the final intention is to competing nationally at the annual collegiate level competitions.  
- Managed a team of 43 participants, separated into design, fundraising, marketing, and more granular teams such as engine fabrication, aerodynamics and suspension.
- Worked with faculty to leverage their experience with design to come up with realistic models that were initially modeled in SolidWorks CAD software and then executed by building scale models in composite forms. Testing smaller scales in a wind tunnel to iterate and maximize efficiency.
- Created budgeting reports for the entirety of the vehicle totaling $120,000 using lean methodologies to form a minimal product needed for our first iteration. Moving forward I lead fundraising efforts, collaborating with local businesses and other entities to obtain materials needed for the build.
- Conducted market research on requirements for the vehicle, leveraging public information available from our university competitors with similar budgets on how they were able to execute on their designs with limited resources. Iterated on our processes to create a effective design pipeline.
- Formula SAE had existed at our university for 9 years with nothing to show but some rough designs, as President I was the first student to design, fund and execute the difficult process of building a miniature Formula 1 car all while finishing my engineering degree. Resulting in our university being able to compete collegiately, and ballooning our participant processes requiring a tough selection process to join the team in the future.

**Co-Owner AM Motorsports** 
Managed a 5000 Sq ft, 12 employee performance shop specializing in custom tubular chassis, performance engines for NASA / SCCA purpose built vehicles.
